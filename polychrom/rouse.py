Simulation parameters
---------------------

This module provides some intuition for the units that are used in polychrome.
For example, the mass of a particle is automatically set to 100 amu and 
the collision rate is set depending on the integrator. For Brownian integrators,
setting the collision rate to 2.0 works well, whereas for Langevin integrators,
it is best to set the collision rate to 0.001-0.01. For loop extrusion simulations,
it is typically set to 0.1. These values have been determined empirically by group
members. For Brownian dynamics, for example, using a smaller collision rate leads
to integration failures. 

In any case, the monomer diffusion coefficient naturally follows as
:math:`D=k_B T / m \zeta`, where :math:`\zeta` is the collision rate. So once the
mass and collision rate are set, there is no control over the choice of D unless
you use a custom Brownian integrator (see integrators module) that directly takes
in D as a parameter. However, even then, the units of D are in terms of 
:math:`k_B T / m \zeta`.

The other arbitrary parameters are the monomer radius, set to sim.conlen = 1 nm
by default, and the bondWiggleDistance. The monomer radius sets the length scale
at which repulsive self-avoidance occurs. the bondWiggleDistance, :math:`x`, sets
the stiffness, :math:`k`,  of the springs connecting adjacent monomers, such that
:math:`k = 2k_B T / x^2`. For a Rouse chain, :math:`k = 3 k_B T / y^2`, where
:math:`y` is the standard deviation of the bond extension. Every Rouse chain 
is secretely a wormlike chain at shorter length scales; thus, :math:`y` should
be set to the end-to-end distance of the underlying WLC, which is defined as 
:math:`y = \sqrt{L_0 b}`, where :math:`L_0` is the length of DNA per monomer and
:math:`b` is the Kuhn length. These relations imply that the bondWiggleDistance
should be set to :math:`x = \sqrt{2L_0 b / 3}`. 

Note that all length scales in
polychrome are in terms of sim.conlen = 1 nm. So :math:`L_0` and :math:`b` should
also be in nanometers. It is not obvious how to convert from nanometers of
chromatin to basepairs. One way of doing it is using the formula
n_basepairs = (n_nm / 0.34 nm/bp) * (1 + 146/<L>), where <L> is the average linker
length in the cell. For example, for human T cells, <L> = 50 bp; so b=40nm of 
cumulative linker length would translate to 469 bp of chromatin, where we account
for the buried DNA in nucleosomes. We can also invert this relation to get
n_nm = n_basepairs/(1 + 146/<L>) * 0.34 nm/bp. So if we would like each monomer
to represent 2 kilobases, this would translate to 174 nm of cumulative linker length.
Using these values as an example, the resulting bondWiggleDistance would be
sqrt(2Lb/3) = 68 nm. We then divide by the size of a monomer to understand what the
bondWiggleDistance would be in terms of sim.conlen. So if we posit that the diameter
of a bead is equal to 34 nm, the bondWiggleDistance would be close to 2.0. This is 
a much larger number than 0.1, which is what is used as default in polychrome! 

Generally, the more coarse-grained the simulation is, the more flexible the springs
should be and the larger the bondWiggleDistance should be, since there is more DNA
per bead.

For a self avoiding polymer there are 2 main dimensionless numbers to keep in mind.
One is Ddt/b^2 and the other is a/b, where a is the radius of a monomer and b is the
Kuhn length. Recall that D and dt are set arbitrarily based on computational convenience,
and a is set to 1 nm by default. Thus, even if length scales and time scales can be
rescaled at the end of the simulation to match experimental data, these ratios should
be decided on beforehand and preserved. Most people set the rest length of the spring
to be the diameter of the monomer = 1 nm.
